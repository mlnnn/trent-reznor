    <hr>
    <p>Michael Trent Reznor (born May 17, 1965) is an American musician. Reznor is the founder and main creative force
        behind the industrial rock band <em><strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong></em>. He is also the only official member
        of
        the
        band,
        as he composes and plays all the instruments himself;
        however,
        different producers,
        engineers and musicians are assembled to assist him in writing and performing new material,
        and a backing band accompanies him on live shows. Reznor writes all of the lyrics himself and is in sole control
        of
        the group.</p>
